# Array Iteration

- **forEach()** - Pretty much the same as a standard for loop. Takes a callback function and can run the callback function on each element one by one.

- **filter()** - Takes a callback function. It returns a new array consiting of all the elements that passed the condition of the callback function.

  - Used for filtering out elements of an array.

- **map()** - Takes a callback function. That cb can perform alterations to each element one by one.

  - Used for creating a new altered array based on the existing array.

- **reduce()** - Takes a callback function. Returns one single output value.

  - Used for things like summing the value of an array or "Flattening" an array (ex. turning a multi-leveled array into a standard array).
